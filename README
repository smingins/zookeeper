== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby Interface to Yahoo's ZooKeeper http://zookeeper.wiki.sourceforge.net/


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Work in progress -- most of the needed ZooKeeper methods have been supported.
Queue was a hacked copy from the Java Tutorial on the site --- will refactor into a useable Recipe at some point.
ACL issues exist in ZooKeeper that have been patched, but patch only seems to work on trunk (Revision 176).  See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-48

== TODO

Extend support for Ruby using ZooKeeper C API's

== SYNOPSIS:

Given a running ZooKeeper server listening for a client connection on port 2181:

  zk = ZooKeeper.new(:host => "localhost:2181")
  zk.create(:path => "/test", :data => "test_data")
  
See spec/zookeeper_spec for expected use and behaviour.

== REQUIREMENTS:

ZooKeeper installed and running.

I built zookeeper from source with the ACL patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12384350/acl_3.patch applied

For MRI version, ZooKeeper C client library (http://zookeeper.sourceforge.net/)

== INSTALL:

gem install smingins-zookeeper --source=http://gems.github.com/

jruby -S  gem install smingins-zookeeper --source=http://gems.github.com/

== TESTS:

To run specs for MRI version execute extconf.rb to create makefile and then run make to create zookeeper_c.bundle, then run specs.
